Post section is a map `<FORK> => [TransactionResults]`

The test can have many fork results and each fork result can have many transaction results.

In generated test indexes are a single digit and could not be array. Thus define a single transaction from the test.
See transaction section which define transactions by `data`, `gasLimit`, `value` arrays.
