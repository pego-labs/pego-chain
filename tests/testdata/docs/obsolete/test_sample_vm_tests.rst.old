Sample Virtual Machine Tests
=================================

Location `/VMTests <https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/VMTests>`_


The VM tests in this directory can only be executed by:

- The no longer supported **testeth** utility
- By custom tools created by developers for their own clients. 

The structure of these tests is similar to the structure of the 
`VM tests source code <../test_filler/vm_filler.html>`_, please refer to that 
documentation for more information. 

.. note::
   Numeric fields in test source code are strings which can be either decimal
   or hexadecimal values. Generated tests are supposed to only have hexadecimal
   values.
