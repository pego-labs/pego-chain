# This test looks for a few possible problem states with timestamps:
#
# 1. A block with the same timestamp as the parent is invalid
# 2. A block with a timestamp prior to its parent is invalid
# 3. A block with a timestamp one second after its parent is valid
#
# All three conditions come from inequality (49) of the yellow paper
# (https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf, p. 7)
#
# Note that as this test includes blocks that create exceptions, it cannot be
# --filltests on besu currently.
#
# The timestamp is in seconds. p. 5 of the yellow paper 
# (https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) specifies it is the output
# of Unix's time(). According to https://linux.die.net/man/2/time that is seconds.
